# Contact

### What is it?

Contact is a (work-in-progress) software based game console.
With the power of virtual machines, a compiler can be built for
a made up assembly language, and can then be run virtually as
"machine code". This power is going to be used to create almost
an emulator of sorts for a custom game console.

### Contributing

No contribution are being accepted at the moment. Once a basic
virtual machine has been created, help will be considered
for optimization and the creation of the console OS and
games.
